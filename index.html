        <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>
        <p><em><strong>Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</strong></em> is a leader in the movement to teach
        <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
        command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
        everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
        Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
        We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from
        learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our

        HTML was created by the original "web developer,"" computer scientist <a href="https://www.wikipedia.com/Tim_Berners_Lee">Tim Burner-Lee</a>. It's not true that Tim invented HTML in order to share pictures of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p><em><strong>Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</strong></em> is an outgrowth of the 
        <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and the
        <a href="https://www.softcover.io" target="_blank">Softcover publishing platform</a>
        This page is part of the sample site for 
        <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/html" target="_blank">Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous</a>, which
        teaches the basics of <strong>H</strong>ypertext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage,
        the universal language of the World Wide Web. Other related tutorials can be found at

        <h2>Founders</h2>
        <p><em><strong>Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</strong></em> was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee
           Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical
           sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit
           at least a billion people, and probably more.

        Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and principal author of the

        <p>When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes
        on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
        interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
        interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

        <p>You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
        Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
        at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
        tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
